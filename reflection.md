What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first, we listed all the functions we wish the computer and the resale shop files to have in a google doc, which we found out really helpful because we can refer to the list when writing specific codes and methods in order to make sure that every function needed is included. 

Then, we are little bit confused about how to reorganize the procedual code into an object-oriented way. Specifically, we first write all the methods in the resaleshop file, and found out that there weren't any methods for the computer class. Then, we spent a lot of time wondering and discussing which of the methods is going to be placed within the Computer class. 

Another problem we encountered is that we had a lot of error messages when importing the computer class and its methods into the resaleshop file, but we finally figured it out. 

One advice is that students should try to avoid being trapped by thinking about how to write the specific code, but instead, think about the actual functions of computers and resaleshop in the real life context, which can help students better understand the logic and also the methods they should add to that class.
